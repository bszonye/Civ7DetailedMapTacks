Upcoming:
* CTRL+Mouse wheel to adjust preview radius. (If possible)
* Calculate bonus yields for the constructible, like Granary warehouse yields.

Backlog:
* Click map tack to bring up options include edit, delete, rename.
* Update map tack yields upon a) tradition changed, b) tech/civic/attribute tree unlocks, c) pantheon selected, etc. Instead of a bulk update upon next turn begin.
* Settings to change icon sizes
* Select generic map tack to pull up corresponding possible constructibles, like wonders.
