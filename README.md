Upcoming:
* Generic map tacks like generic food/gold buildings.
* Hotkeys to open map tack chooser screen, if the game supports it.

Backlog:
* Calculate bonus yields for the constructible, like Granary warehouse yields.
* More validation checks.
* Update map tack yields upon a) tradition changed, b) tech/civic/attribute tree unlocks, c) pantheon selected, etc. Instead of a bulk update upon next turn begin.
* Click to update the map tack with delete option instead delete directly.
