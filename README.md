Upcoming:
* Select generic map tack to pull up corresponding possible constructibles.
* Click map tack to bring up options include edit, delete, rename.

Backlog:
* Update map tack yields upon a) tradition changed, b) tech/civic/attribute tree unlocks, c) pantheon selected, etc. Instead of a bulk update upon next turn begin.
* Settings to change icon sizes
* More bonus yield calculation (upon requests)
